At line 18, there is a list variable that is used to test the function 'isOdds'. 
Change what it is initialized to to test different inputs.

From line 22 to line 76, there is a class named 'Ham'. In this class, there is
a constructor at line 29, a decimal to binary function at line 37, and a function to calculate 
hamming distance at line 49. This is interfaced in the console when you run the file. All
inputs are done through the console, too.

In the main, there is a while loop containing an input statement with an EOFError
for Ctrl+D. When you run the file, you will be able to enter inputs and once you 
input Ctrl+D, the previous inputs will be outputted in the reverse order in which
they were entered.

At line 103, there is a function that will recursively print permutations of an inputted array.
The array that is used in the calling of the function is located on line 116 and can be changed
to test other types of arrays.
