--------------------------------------Hw5Prob1.java--------------------------------------

The Hw5Prob1.java file contains the solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem. To test a 
tower size, simply call the function with any size integer, and three Strings for the
peg names.

--------------------------------------Hw5Prob2.java--------------------------------------

The Hw5Prob2.java file contains the solution to outputting inorder and preorder traversal
solutions as lists from a given binary tree. To test a tree, you can either input an 
integer array with -1 substituting null, or use a node based binary tree. Set the child
nodes and run.
