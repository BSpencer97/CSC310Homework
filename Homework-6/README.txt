--------------------------------------Hw5Prob1.java--------------------------------------

The Hw5Prob1.java file contains the solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem. To test a 
tower size, simply call the function with any size integer, and three Strings for the
peg names.

--------------------------------------Hw5Prob2.java--------------------------------------

The Hw5Prob2.java file contains the solution to outputting inorder and preorder traversal
solutions as lists from a given binary tree. To test a tree, you can either input an 
integer array with -1 substituting null, or use a node based binary tree. Set the child
nodes and run.

-------------------------------------InsertionSort.py--------------------------------------
InsertionSort.py contains an insertion-sort program using a priority queue implemented with 
a sorted list. To test this, initialize a PriorityQueue object and an array, then call the
insertSeq(array) method. Next, print the array to see that it is now sorted.

----------------------------------------HeapSort.py----------------------------------------
HeapSort.py contains an in-place heap-sort program. To test this, initialize an array and
call the heapSort(array) method and print the array to see that it is now sorted.

---------------------------------------BinMinHeap.py---------------------------------------
BinMinHeap.py contains a binary min heap with basic operations. To test this, create a 
BinHeap object and call any of the operations.
